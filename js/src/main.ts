//const works as a real const
const hello1 = "word";
//since we are defining the variable as a default value, if we will define it as a new value we will get an error for sure
// hello : '23';
// ❌ => hello = "foo"
console.log(hello1);

//Variable Let
let hello2 = "word2";
//in this case Let variable will allowe us to set a new value in it, we won't get an error, don't worry
hello2 = "thisIsWord";
// hello2 : "string" = "";
